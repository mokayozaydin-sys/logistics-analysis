# Maritime Logistics Data Warehouse & BI Automation

## 📌 Executive Summary
In the global supply chain, relying on static spreadsheets for maritime operations (Ocean Import) often leads to delayed decisions and obscured cost inefficiencies. This project solves that problem by replacing manual tracking with a fully automated **Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Warehouse** pipeline. 

Developed with an Industrial Engineering perspective, the system extracts raw shipping data, models it into a relational database using embedded SQL, and automatically generates executive-level KPI dashboards.

## 🎯 Business Problem & Solution
* **The Problem:** Raw shipment data containing thousands of rows of dates, routes, and TEU volumes is difficult to analyze dynamically. Hidden costs (customs vs. inland transport) and route bottlenecks are often missed.
* **The Solution:** A Python-based ETL pipeline that cleanses the data, structures it into a Star Schema database, and runs complex SQL aggregations to identify cost-saving opportunities and transit bottlenecks.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & ETL Pipeline
The system is built on a modular, scalable architecture:

1. **Extraction & Data Cleansing (Pandas):** - Ingests raw maritime data (`.csv`).
   - Handles missing operational data and validates chronologies (Departure vs. Predicted ETA).
2. **Database Modeling (Embedded SQLite):** - Normalizes data into a Star Schema directly within Python.
   - **Dimension Table:** `Ports` (Origin and Destination).
   - **Fact Tables:** `Shipments` (routing, schedules) and `Costs` (freight, customs, inland transport).
3. **Analytics Engine (Advanced SQL):** - Executes complex queries (`JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `JULIANDAY` math) within Python to compute absolute lead times and aggregated costs without overloading system memory.
4. **Data Visualization (Seaborn/Matplotlib):** - Iterates through container objects to label exact data points, generating standalone, high-resolution PNG reports.

## 📊 Analytical Dashboards & Business Value
Running the pipeline automatically outputs 5 distinct BI reports:

1. **`01_origin_cost_report.png`:** Evaluates the Top 10 most expensive origin ports, allowing procurement teams to negotiate better freight rates.
2. **`02_origin_time_report.png`:** Lead time analysis highlighting the slowest origin routes to optimize supply chain planning.
3. **`03_destination_density_report.png`:** Analyzes inbound shipment volumes per destination port for better yard management and resource allocation.
4. **`04_popular_routes_report.png`:** Identifies the most frequently utilized logistics corridors (Origin ➔ Destination).
5. **`05_cost_breakdown_pie_chart.png`:** Provides a proportional distribution of Freight, Customs, and Inland Transport, uncovering hidden operational expenditures.
